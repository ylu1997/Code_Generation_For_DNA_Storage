# Code_Generation_For_DNA_Storage

This GitHub repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing a Codebook generation method for DNA storage. Currently, it serves as a repository for storing experimental data and code used for verification purposes.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to develop a robust encoding method for DNA storage that can effectively correct errors arising from substitutions, insertions, and deletions simultaneously. The emphasis is on the generation of a codebook that enables error correction in the context of DNA data storage.

## Contents
- **Data:** Store some experimental results and comparative data, as well as codebooks for other adversarial scenarios.
- **Codebook Generation Scheme** The initial version of the code for ECG and codebook generation in the research paper. This folder will not be made public until the paper is published. 


## Future Work

As the project progresses, future plans may includ：
- **Efficient Implementation of Codebook Generation.** Reduce unnecessary computations in each iteration and parallelize the loss calculation on the GPU.
- **Efficient Encoding and Decoding Implementation.** Implementation of an efficient encoding and decoding algorithm based on ECG.
- **A Better Optimization.** An efficient DFO (Derivative-Free Optimization) algorithm tailored for codebook generation.
- **More Powerful ECG.** Upgrade the edit computational graph (ECG) to allow for the generation of error-correcting codebooks tailored for general adversarial scenarios, such as burst errors and duplication.
