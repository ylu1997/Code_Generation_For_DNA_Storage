# Regret and Reflection on My Incomplete Work

Despite my earnest efforts to complete this project on multi-pattern regex matching for multicore CPUs, I now realize that there is still so much left undone. Recently, I discovered that others have already published significant advancements in this area—such as the paper [HybridSA: GPU Acceleration of Multi-pattern Regex Matching using Bit Parallelism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3689771).

It's disheartening to see that, even though I tried to carry out this work, many aspects remain unfinished, and my efforts now seem overshadowed by these new innovations. I can't help but feel that much of what I worked on was incomplete, leaving me with a sense of regret over all that was left undone.

This realization is a stark reminder of how quickly the field moves and how much more there is to learn and improve. While it pains me to see my work as only a partial step in a much larger journey, I also hope it will motivate me to continue pushing forward and eventually catch up with these advancements.

The multi-cpu part is finished. For GPU version is still incomplete, I am not sure if anyone care about it.

The power of the individual is too small.

 *Special thanks to the development of AI, which has enabled me to retrieve developments in areas I wasn’t familiar with—even if they aren’t the very latest.*

# Code_Generation_For_DNA_Storage

This GitHub repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing a Codebook generation method for DNA storage. Currently, it serves as a repository for storing experimental data and code used for verification purposes.

The arXiv link to the article is as follows: [Unrestricted Error-Type Codebook Generation for Error Correction Code in DNA Storage Inspired by NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15915) 
## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to develop a robust encoding method for DNA storage that can effectively correct errors arising from substitutions, insertions, and deletions simultaneously. The emphasis is on the generation of a codebook that enables error correction in the context of DNA data storage.

## Contents
- **Data:** Store some experimental results and comparative data, as well as codebooks for other adversarial scenarios.
- **Codebook Generation Scheme** The initial version of the code for ECG and codebook generation in the research paper. This folder will not be made public until the paper is published.
