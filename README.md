# Regret and Reflection

After dedicating a lot of time to developing a multi-pattern regex matching solution for multicore CPUs, I recently discovered that someone else has already published an article on GPU acceleration for this problem: [HybridSA: GPU Acceleration of Multi-pattern Regex Matching using Bit Parallelism](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3689771). 
 
Nonetheless, it's a stark reminder of how quickly technological progress can render previous work outdated.

# Code_Generation_For_DNA_Storage

This GitHub repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing a Codebook generation method for DNA storage. Currently, it serves as a repository for storing experimental data and code used for verification purposes.

The arXiv link to the article is as follows: [Unrestricted Error-Type Codebook Generation for Error Correction Code in DNA Storage Inspired by NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15915) 
## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to develop a robust encoding method for DNA storage that can effectively correct errors arising from substitutions, insertions, and deletions simultaneously. The emphasis is on the generation of a codebook that enables error correction in the context of DNA data storage.

## Contents
- **Data:** Store some experimental results and comparative data, as well as codebooks for other adversarial scenarios.
- **Codebook Generation Scheme** The initial version of the code for ECG and codebook generation in the research paper. This folder will not be made public until the paper is published.
